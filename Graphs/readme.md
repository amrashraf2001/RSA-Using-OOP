# Graph module
### just an explainer graph that proves the infeasibility of factorization of large numbers except by brute forcing


### Also Brute forcing times is somewhat exponential against the length of the secret number

### Also proving the exponential encryption time with larger key lengths, even when using a compiled language (CPP)

## Run it yourself
#### to run Encryption Time vs Key length:
```
  python EncTime.py <UpperLimitOfn>
ex:
  python EncTime.py 5000
```


#### to run Brute Forcing Time vs Key length:
```
  python BFTime.py <the_first_K_Keys>
ex:
  python BFTime.py 500
```
